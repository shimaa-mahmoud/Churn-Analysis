# Customer Churn Prediction

## Introduction
We will work with a data from a telecommunications provider to try to understand more about the customer churning and how can we predict the customer churning. We will use Python and jupyter notebook to preform the required analysis and the ML models

The libraries used are Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Sklearn
## Data Description
The training dataset contains 3333 samples. Each sample contains 20 features (6 Categorical and 14 Continous) and 1 boolean variable "churn" which indicates the class of the sample.
## Notebook Content
1. Data Wrangling
2. Data Cleaning
3. EDA( Univarient EDA\  Bivarient EDA )
4. Feature Engineering
5. Data Preprocessing
6. Applying ML models
